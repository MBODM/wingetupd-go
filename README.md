# wingetupd-go
A tiny command line tool using WinGet to update Windows packages (written in Go) 

### Reasons

I recently was curious about the Go programming language (golang). So i started some re-development of my existing [wingetupd](https://github.com/MBODM/wingetupd) project. This version of `wingetupd.exe` (this time written in Go) shall become exactly the same tool as the original `wingetupd.exe` (which was written in C# and .NET 6).

__Another reason was also:__ The original `wingetupd.exe` (as a .NET 6 self-contained application) is around 10-15 MB in size. The `wingetupd.exe` in Go will become more like 1-3 MB in size.

__But, to be honest, the most prominent reason was:__ I recently was also curious about the Rust programming language. So i already started a re-development in Rust (see [wingetupd-rust](https://github.com/MBODM/wingetupd-rust)). After 2 weeks of Rust i came to the conclusion: Rust isn¬¥t for me. Even when i finally understood Rust¬¥s system of borrowing, ownership, and lifetime, it¬¥s literally _‚Äûpainful to the point of unusability‚Äú_, as said in [this](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=7294) blog post. I personally totally agree to what this guy says. So i stopped my Rust experiment after 2 weeks. And when you take a look around, Go shows up rather fast, as some alternative to Rust. Now i wanna see how re-writing it in golang feels to me.

#### So, here we "go" again. üòÅ
